    "# Introduction\n",
    "There are multiple different ways to do certain things. Each of the different ways have pros and cons, and sometimes can tell somewhat different stories. Often the different ways come with different syntaxes, increasing the learning curve for users. `Voyager` took inspiration from `caret` and `tidymodels` [@Kuhn2020-fm] for machine learning, `foreach`, `future`, and `BiocParallel` for parallel processing with different backends, `bluster` for different clustering algorithms, and `BiocNeighbors` for different algorithms to find nearest neighbors. These packages provide uniform user interfaces to different methods to achieve a given goal. \n",
    "\n",
    "In `caret` and `tidymodels`, users can make the uniform user interface fit custom models not included in the package to eliminate a lot of duplicate code. In `Voyager`, this is done with the `SFEMethod` S4 class. This vignette shows how to use the `SFEMethod` class to use Voyager's uniform user interface on you own custom methods.\n",
