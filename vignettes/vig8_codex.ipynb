    "The dataset used in this vignette is from the paper [Strategies for Accurate Cell Type Identification in CODEX Multiplexed Imaging Data](doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.727626)(Hickey, et.al 2021). The data were collected as part of the HuBMap consortium which seeks to characterize healthy human tissues and make data  broadly available. More specifically, this dataset characterizes 4 regions of the large intestine (colon) from a single donor. This vignette will focus on data from the sigmoid colon. \n",

    "The intestinal sections were interrogated using the multiplexed imaging method CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX). CODEX involves cyclical staining of a tissue with DNA-barcoded antibodies. At each round of experimentation, fluoresently labeled probes hybridize to the tissue bound DNA-conjugated antibodies are subsequently imaged and the stripped from the tissue. At present, the technology quantifies up to 60 markers in a single experiment. Raw images generated from this process are subjected to image stitching, drift compensation, deconvolution, and cycle concatenation using publicly avaialable [software](https://github.com/nolanlab/CODEX). The result of this pre-processing is a matrix that contains the location of individual cells and the quantified markers for each cell. Cell types were assigned as described in the manuscript linked above. Briefly, the authors used a hand-gating strategy to define cell types and create a standard to compare the effect of normalization methods on clustering and cell annotation. \n",

A complimentary task might be to identify spatially variable (SV) genes. One such method to do this is described in [SpatialDE: identification of spatially variable genes](). The method described in the manuscript relies on Gaussian process regression and decomposes variability in expression into spatial and non-spatial components. In contrast to Moran's I, the covariance between each pair of cells is modeled as a function of the distance between them. Notably, it does not require an explicit specification of hte neighborhood graph, but rather the a parameter controls the decay in covariance as distance increases. \n",
