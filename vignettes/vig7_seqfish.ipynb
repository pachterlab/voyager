    "The data used in this vignette are described in [Integration of spatial and single-cell transcriptomic data elucidates mouse organogenesis](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-021-01006-2). Briefly, seqFISH was use to profile 351 genes in several mouse embryos at the 8-12 somite stage (ss). We will focus on a single biological replicate, embryo 3. The raw and processed counts and corresponding metadata are available to download from the [Marioni lab](https://content.cruk.cam.ac.uk/jmlab/SpatialMouseAtlas2020/). Expression matrices, segmentation data, and segmented cell vertices are provided as R objects that can be readily imported into an R environment. The data relevant to this vignette have been converted to a `SFE` object and are available to download [here](https://caltech.box.com/public/static/ulrqr1gk7oh21h9ejgua1xajs6dsbvrj) from Box.  \n",

    "At this point, we may be interested in identifying genes that exhibit spatial variability, or whose expression depends on spatial location within the tissue. Measures of spatial autocorrelation can be useful in identifyign genes that display spatial variablity. Among the most common measures are Moran's I and Geary's C. In the latter case, a less than 1 indicates positive spatial autocorrelation, while a value larger than 1 points to negative spatial autocorrelation. In the former case, positive and negative values of Moran's I indicate positive and negative spatial autocorrelation, respectively.\n",
