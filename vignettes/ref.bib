              Here, we introduce the Visium HD platform (10x Genomics) and use
              it to investigate human CRC and normal adjacent mucosal tissues
              from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples. The first
              assay available on Visium HD is a probe-based spatial
              transcriptomics workflow that was developed to enable whole
              transcriptome single cell scale analysis. We demonstrate highly
              refined unsupervised spatial clustering in Visium HD data that
              aligns with the hallmarks of colon tissue morphology and is
              notably improved over earlier Visium assays. Using serial sections
              from the same FFPE blocks we generate a single cell atlas of our
              samples, then we integrate the data to comprehensively
              characterize the immune cell types present in the TME,
              specifically at the tumor periphery. We observed enrichment of two
              pro-tumor macrophage subpopulations with differential gene
              expression profiles that were localized within distinct tumor
              regions. Further characterization of the T cells present in one of
              the samples revealed a clonal expansion that we were able to
              localize in the tissue using in situ gene expression analysis. In
              situ analysis also allowed us to perform in-depth characterization
              of the microenvironment of the clonally expanded T cell population
              and we identified a third macrophage subpopulation with gene
              expression profiles consistent with an anti-tumor response. Our
              study provides a comprehensive map of the cellular composition of
              the CRC TME and identifies phenotypically and spatially distinct
              immune cell populations within it. We show that the single
              cell-scale resolution afforded by Visium HD and the whole
              transcriptome nature of the assay allows investigations into
              cellular function and interaction at the tumor periphery in FFPE
              tissues, which has not been previously possible.",

              subcellular resolution in three dimensions. Quantification and

               popular today. One of the motivations for the use of such

               there are advantages for analysis purposes over the irregular
               spatial polygons defined by political jurisdictions. There is no
               doubt that there are notational simplifications; one can index a

               the cell in the ith row and jth column becomes the cell i,j.

               and results from the fact that in such a scheme every country in

              conducted with spatial data containing massive numbers of

              autocorrelation statistics are based on rather small sample sizes,
              in the context of massive spatial datasets, this paper presents
              extensions to efficiency and statistical power comparisons between
              the Moran coefficient and the Geary ratio for different variable
              distribution assumptions and selected geographic neighborhood

              results for small n extend to large and massively large n,
              especially for non-normal variables; implications established are
              relevant to big spatial data. To achieve these comparisons, this
              paper summarizes proofs of limiting variances, also called
              asymptotic variances, to do the efficiency analysis, and derives
              the relationship function between the two statistics to compare
              their statistical power at the same scale. Visualization of this
              statistical power analysis employs an alternative technique that
              already appears in the literature, furnishing additional
              understanding and clarity about these spatial autocorrelation

              efficient than the Geary ratio for most surface partitionings,
              because this index has a relatively smaller asymptotic as well as
              exact variance, and the superior power of the Moran coefficient
              vis-à-vis the Geary ratio for positive spatial autocorrelation
              depends upon the type of geographic configuration, with this power
              approaching one as sample sizes become increasingly large. Because

              [e.g., binary 0--1 (rook or queen adjacencies), nearest neighbors,
              inverse inter-point distance, row standardized], which may cause
              confusion about output from different software packages; to date,
              JCS calculations have been using only binary 0--1 definitions. The

              merit closer examination; although the mean and other details of
              the sampling distribution for the MC are well-known, at least the

               channels 1 and 2 spectral response functions from SPOT VGT1 to
               SPOT VGT2 in 2003. Trend analysis of AVHRR GIMMS NDVI exhibits a
               regression slope range in better agreement with Terra MODIS NDVI
               for semi-arid areas. However, GIMMS NDVI shows a tendency towards

              types of log-linear cell type-specific expression functions.
              C-SIDE's framework applies to many contexts: DE due to pathology,
              anatomical regions, cell-to-cell interactions and cellular

              parts-based representation. However, in applications such as
              spatial transcriptomics, NMF fails to incorporate known structure
              between observations. Here, we present nonnegative spatial
              factorization (NSF), a spatially-aware probabilistic dimension

              than real-valued alternatives such as MEFISTO in simulations, and
              has lower out-of-sample prediction error than probabilistic NMF on
              three spatial transcriptomics datasets from mouse brain and liver.
              Since not all patterns of gene expression have spatial

              technologies provide a much denser spot placement leading to
              subcellular resolution. A key challenge for these newer methods is
              cell segmentation and the assignment of spots to cells.
              Traditional image-based segmentation methods are limited and do

              datasets and 88 publicly available single-cell (scRNAseq) and

              sequencing technologies provide powerful tools for understanding
              cells in the physical context of tissue microenvironments. A
              fundamental task in spatial gene expression analysis is to
              identify genes with spatially variable expression patterns, or
              spatially variable genes (SVgenes). Several computational methods
              have been developed for this task. Their high computational
              complexity limited their scalability to the latest and future
              large-scale spatial expression data. RESULTS: We present SOMDE, an
              efficient method for identifying SVgenes in large-scale spatial
              expression data. SOMDE uses self-organizing map to cluster
              neighboring cells into nodes, and then uses a Gaussian process to
              fit the node-level spatial gene expression to identify SVgenes.
              Experiments show that SOMDE is about 5-50 times faster than
              existing methods with comparable results. The adjustable
              resolution of SOMDE makes it the only method that can give results
              in ∼5 min in large datasets of more than 20 000 sequencing sites.

              be a good model for counts data from both bulk and single-cell
              RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Gaussian process (GP) regression
              provides a useful non-parametric approach for modelling temporal
              or spatial changes in gene expression. However, currently
              available GP regression methods that implement negative binomial
              likelihood models do not scale to the increasingly large datasets
              being produced by single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.
              RESULTS: The GPcounts package implements GP regression methods for
              modelling counts data using a negative binomial likelihood
              function. Computational efficiency is achieved through the use of
              variational Bayesian inference. The GP function models changes in
              the mean of the negative binomial likelihood through a logarithmic
              link function and the dispersion parameter is fitted by maximum
              likelihood. We validate the method on simulated time course data,
              showing better performance to identify changes in over-dispersed
              counts data than methods based on Gaussian or Poisson likelihoods.
              To demonstrate temporal inference, we apply GPcounts to
              single-cell RNA-seq datasets after pseudotime and branching
              inference. To demonstrate spatial inference, we apply GPcounts to
              data from the mouse olfactory bulb to identify spatially variable
              genes and compare to two published GP methods. We also provide the
              option of modelling additional dropout using a zero-inflated
              negative binomial. Our results show that GPcounts can be used to
              model temporal and spatial counts data in cases where simpler
              Gaussian and Poisson likelihoods are unrealistic. AVAILABILITY AND

              However, in R/Bioconductor, there is a scarcity of existing

              In biology, single-cell expression studies almost always begin
              with reduction to two or three dimensions to produce `all-in-one'
              visuals of the data that are amenable to the human eye, and these
              are subsequently used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of
              cell relationships. However, there is little theoretical support
              for this practice. We examine the theoretical and practical
              implications of low-dimensional embedding of single-cell data, and

              properties of biological patterns relative to the

              semi-supervised dimensionality reduction to higher dimension, and

              current methods do not sufficiently explore the expressiveness of
              the multi-modal SRT data, leaving a large room for improvement of
              performance. Moreover, the current deep learning based methods

              its further applications in the areas that require explanation.
              Results We propose conST, a powerful and flexible SRT data
              analysis framework utilizing contrastive learning techniques.
              conST can learn low-dimensional embeddings by effectively
              integrating multi-modal SRT data, i . e . gene expression, spatial
              information, and morphology (if applicable). The learned
              embeddings can be then used for various downstream tasks,
              including clustering, trajectory and pseudotime inference,

              datasets have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and
              robustness of the proposed conST, achieving up to 10\% improvement

              VR-Omics is the first tool capable of analysing and visualising
              data generated by multiple SRT platforms in both 2D desktop and
              virtual reality environments. It incorporates an in-built workflow
              to automatically pre-process and spatially mine the data within a
              user-friendly graphical user interface. Benchmarking VR-Omics
              against other comparable software demonstrates its seamless
              end-to-end analysis of SRT data, hence making SRT data processing
              and mining universally accessible. VR-Omics is an open-source

              workflows rely on methods that embed and visualize the properties
              of a k-nearest neighbor (kNN) graph in two-dimensions. These
              visualizations are typically combined with categorical labels
              assigned to individual data points and can support a range of
              analysis tasks, despite the fact that these embeddings are known
              to distort the local and global properties of the graph. Rather
              than relying on a two-dimensional visualization, we introduce a
              method for quantitatively assessing the concordance between a set
              of labels and the k-nearest neighbor graph. Our method, called
              CONCORDEX, computes for each node the fraction of neighbors with
              the same or different label, and compares the result to the mean
              obtained with random labeling of the graph. CONCORDEX can be used
              for any categorical label and can be interpreted via an intuitive
              heatmap visualization. We demonstrate its utility for assessment
              of clustering results and ``integration''. Since CONCORDEX can be
              used to directly visualize properties of a kNN graph, we also use

              Normalization of gene expression data is often needed to account
              for technical factors that may confound underlying biological
              signals. Here, we investigate the potential impact of different
              gene count normalization methods with different targeted gene
              panels in the analysis and interpretation of im-SRT data. Using
              different simulated gene panels that overrepresent genes expressed

              normalization methods based on detected gene counts per cell
              differentially impact normalized gene expression magnitudes in a
              region- or cell type-specific manner. We show that these

              count-based normalization methods if necessary. Overall, we

               this respect. In this paper, I outline a new general class of
               local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they
               allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's
               I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics
               serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as
               indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots,
               similar to the Gi and G*i statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On
               the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of
               individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and
               to identify ?outliers,? as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot
               (1993a). An initial evaluation of the properties of a LISA

               understanding the ecological processes structuring the

               distributions result from a combination of several processes
               occuring at different scales: identifying these scales is thus a
               crucial issue. Recent studies have proposed a new family of
               spatial predictors (PCNM: principal coordinates of neighbours
               matrices; MEMs: Moran's eigenvectors maps) that allow for
               modelling of spatial variation on different scales. To assess the
               multi-scale spatial patterns in multivariate data, these
               variables are often used as predictors in constrained ordination
               methods. However, the selection of the appropriate spatial
               predictors is still troublesome, and the identification of the
               main scales of spatial variation remains an open question. This
               paper presents a new statistical tool to tackle this issue: the
               multi-scale pattern analysis (MSPA). This ordination method uses
               MEMs to decompose ecological variability into several spatial
               scales and then summarizes this decomposition using graphical
               representations. A canonical form of MSPA can also be used to
               assess the spatial scales of the species-environment
               relationships. MSPA is compared to constrained ordination using
               simulated data, and illustrated using the famous oribatid mites

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in
              bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene
              co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for
              describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray
              samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used
              for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for
              summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an
              intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to
              external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and
              for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks
              facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used
              to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These
              methods have been successfully applied in various biological
              contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and
              analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation
              network methodology have been described in separate publications,
              there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and
              consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.
              RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive
              collection of R functions for performing various aspects of
              weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes
              functions for network construction, module detection, gene
              selection, calculations of topological properties, data
              simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software.
              Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials.
              While the methods development was motivated by gene expression
              data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a
              variety of different settings. CONCLUSION: The WGCNA package

              reduction to 2 or 3 dimensions to produce ``all-in-one'' visuals

              subsequently used for qualitative and quantitative exploratory

               Univariate measurements of spatial autocorrelation such as
               Moran's I and Geary's c are widely used, but extensions to the
               multivariate case (i.e. multi-species) are rare. Here, we propose
               a multivariate spatial analysis based on Moran's I (MULTISPATI)

               the statistical triplet notation. This analysis, which is a

               many variables (multivariate analysis) and their spatial
               structure (autocorrelation). MULTISPATI approach is very flexible

               by making them available to future generations of statisticians,

               spatial data through statistical models --- has proven
               exceptionally versatile, encompassing problems ranging from the
               microscopic to the astronomic. However, for the scientist and
               engineer faced only with scattered and uneven treatments of the
               subject in the scientific literature, learning how to make
               practical use of spatial statistics in day-to-day analytical work
               is very difficult. Designed exclusively for scientists eager to
               tap into the enormous potential of this analytical tool and
               upgrade their range of technical skills, Statistics for Spatial
               Data is a comprehensive, single-source guide to both the theory
               and applied aspects of spatial statistical methods. The
               hard-cover edition was hailed by Mathematical Reviews as an
               ``excellent book which will become a basic reference.'' This
               paper-back edition of the 1993 edition, is designed to meet the
               many technological challenges facing the scientist and engineer.
               Concentrating on the three areas of geostatistical data, lattice
               data, and point patterns, the book sheds light on the link
               between data and model, revealing how design, inference, and
               diagnostics are an outgrowth of that link. It then explores new
               methods to reveal just how spatial statistical models can be used
               to solve important problems in a host of areas in science and
               engineering. Discussion includes: Exploratory spatial data
               analysis Spectral theory for stationary processes Spatial scale
               Simulation methods for spatial processes Spatial bootstrapping
               Statistical image analysis and remote sensing Computational
               aspects of model fitting Application of models to disease mapping

              destruction of histological features and epitopes during the
              workflow. Here, we analyzed large, serial formalin-fixed,
              paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human breast cancer sections using a
              novel FFPE-compatible single cell gene expression workflow
              (Chromium Fixed RNA Profiling; scFFPE-seq), spatial
              transcriptomics (Visium CytAssist), and automated microscopy-based
              in situ technology using a 313-plex gene panel (Xenium In Situ).
              Whole transcriptome profiling of the FFPE tissue using scFFPE-seq
              and Visium facilitated the identification of 17 different cell
              types. Xenium allowed us to spatially resolve these cell types and
              their gene expression profiles with single cell resolution. Due to
              the non-destructive nature of the Xenium workflow, we were able to
              perform H\&E staining and immunofluorescence on the same section
              post-processing which allowed us to spatially register protein,
              histological, and RNA data together into a single image.
              Integration of data from Chromium scFFPE-seq, Visium, and Xenium
              across serial sections allowed us to do extensive benchmarking of
              sensitivity and specificity between the technologies. Furthermore,
              data integration inspired the interrogation of three molecularly
              distinct tumor subtypes (low-grade and high-grade ductal carcinoma
              in situ (DCIS), and invasive carcinoma). We used Xenium to
              characterize the cellular composition and differentially expressed
              genes within these subtypes. This analysis allowed us to draw
              biological insights about DCIS progression to infiltrating
              carcinoma, as the myoepithelial layer degrades and tumor cells
              invade the surrounding stroma. Xenium also allowed us to further
              predict the hormone receptor status of tumor subtypes, including a
              small 0.1 mm2 DCIS region that was triple positive for ESR1
              (estrogen receptor), PGR (progesterone receptor) and ERBB2 (human

              derive whole transcriptome information about these cells, we used
              Xenium data to interpolate the cell composition of Visium spots,
              and leveraged Visium whole transcriptome information to discover
              new biomarkers of breast tumor subtypes. We demonstrate that

              about molecular signatures relevant to understanding cancer

              heterogeneity. Recent spatial technologies are increasing the
              throughput and spatial resolution of measurements, resulting in
              larger datasets. The added spatial dimension and volume of
              measurements poses an analytics challenge that has, in the
              short-term, been addressed by adopting methods designed for the
              analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. Though these methods work
              well in some cases, not all necessarily translate appropriately to
              spatial technologies. A common assumption is that total sequencing
              depth, also known as library size, represents technical variation
              in single-cell RNA-seq technologies, and this is often normalised
              out during analysis. Through analysis of several different spatial
              datasets, we noted that this assumption does not necessarily hold
              in spatial molecular data. To formally assess this, we explore the
              relationship between library size and independently annotated
              spatial regions, across 23 samples from 4 different spatial
              technologies with varying throughput and spatial resolution. We
              found that library size confounded biology across all
              technologies, regardless of the tissue being investigated.
              Statistical modelling of binned total transcripts shows that
              tissue region is strongly associated with library size across all
              technologies, even after accounting for cell density of the bins.
              Through a benchmarking experiment, we show that normalising out
              library size leads to sub-optimal spatial domain identification
              using common graph-based clustering algorithms. On average, better
              clustering was achieved when library size effects were not
              normalised out explicitly, especially with data from the newer
              sub-cellular localised technologies. Taking these results into
              consideration, we recommend that spatial data should not be
              specifically corrected for library size prior to analysis unless
              strongly motivated. We also emphasise that spatial data are
              different to single-cell RNA-seq and care should be taken when
              adopting algorithms designed for single cell data. \#\#\#

               meaning of spatial statistical results gleaned from
               geo-referenced data requires a more complete knowledge of
               properties of the underlying geometry. This paper addresses these
               two topics by further investigating important geometric features
               of spatial data. The importance of this work is expressed in the
               geographic information system literature regarding
               representations of geographic space, as well as various
               geographic literatures concerned with spatial statistical
               modelling. Answers to three questions are obtained here. One asks
               whether or not those eigenvectors associated with the three
               largest eigenvalues of a binary geographic weights matrix have
               natural interpretations. A second question asks whether or not
               the eigenvalues of a geographic weights matrix prove useful in
               understanding the sampling distribution for spatial
               autocorrelation in a given geographic landscape. A third question
               addresses the issue of spatial autocorrelation components of
               geo-refer-enced phenomena. The analysis summarized in this paper
               documents responses to these three questions. Empirical evidence
               is gleaned from both Canadian urban census tract data and the

               variable, and its variability can be explained by the complex
               interplay among several structuring factors. The thorough

               infer processes shaping ecological communities. We suggest that

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: RNA localization involves cis-motifs that are
               recognized by RNA-binding proteins (RBP), which then mediate
               localization to specific sub-cellular compartments. RNA
               localization is critical for many different cell functions, e.g.,
               in neuronal dendrites, localization is a critical step for
               long-lasting synaptic potentiation. However, there is little
               consensus regarding which RNAs are localized and the role of
               alternative isoforms in localization. A comprehensive catalog of
               localized RNA can help dissect RBP/RNA interactions and
               localization motifs. Here, we utilize a single cell sub-cellular
               RNA sequencing approach to profile differentially localized RNAs
               from individual cells across multiple single cells to help
               identify a consistent set of localized RNA in mouse neurons.
               RESULTS: Using independent RNA sequencing from soma and dendrites
               of the same neuron, we deeply profiled the sub-cellular
               transcriptomes to assess the extent and variability of dendritic
               RNA localization in individual hippocampal neurons, including an
               assessment of differential localization of alternative 3'UTR
               isoforms. We identified 2225 dendritic RNAs, including 298 cases
               of 3'UTR isoform-specific localization. We extensively analyzed
               the localized RNAs for potential localization motifs, finding
               that B1 and B2 SINE elements are up to 5.7 times more abundant in
               localized RNA 3'UTRs than non-localized, and also functionally
               characterized the localized RNAs using protein structure
               analysis. CONCLUSION: We integrate our list of localized RNAs
               with the literature to provide a comprehensive list of known
               dendritically localized RNAs as a resource. This catalog of
               transcripts, including differentially localized isoforms and
               computationally hypothesized localization motifs, will help
               investigators further dissect the genome-scale mechanism of RNA
               localization.",

               specific subcellular regions1,5. Here we present CRISPR-mediated
               transcriptome organization (CRISPR-TO), a system that harnesses
               RNA-guided, nuclease-dead dCas13 for programmable control of
               endogenous RNA localization in live cells. CRISPR-TO enables
               targeted localization of endogenous RNAs to diverse subcellular
               compartments, including the outer mitochondrial membrane,
               p-bodies, stress granules, telomeres and nuclear stress bodies,
               across various cell types. It allows for inducible and reversible
               bidirectional RNA transport along microtubules via motor
               proteins, facilitating real-time manipulation and monitoring of
               RNA localization dynamics in living cells. In primary cortical

               with ribosomes, with β-actin mRNA localization enhancing the
               formation of dynamic filopodial protrusions and inhibiting axonal
               regeneration. CRISPR-TO-enabled screening in primary neurons
               identifies Stmn2 mRNA localization as a driver of neurite

               Despite its complex functions, the diversity of molecularly

               major axonal projection targets have not been examined

               (scRNA-seq) to classify molecularly defined cell types in the CEA
               and identified marker genes to map the location of these neuronal

               technologies or collected at different times. FINDINGS: We
               propose spatiAlign, an unsupervised contrastive learning model
               that employs the expression of all measured genes and the spatial
               location of cells, to integrate multiple tissue sections. It

              messenger RNA (mRNA) expression at thousands of locations in a
              tissue slice. However, nearly all SRT technologies measure
              expression in two-dimensional (2D) slices extracted from a 3D
              tissue, thus losing information that is shared across multiple
              slices from the same tissue. Integrating SRT data across multiple
              slices can help recover this information and improve downstream
              expression analyses, but multislice alignment and integration
              remains a challenging task. Existing methods for integrating SRT
              data either do not use spatial information or assume that the
              morphology of the tissue is largely preserved across slices, an
              assumption that is often violated because of biological or
              technical reasons. We introduce PASTE2, a method for partial
              alignment and 3D reconstruction of multislice SRT data sets,
              allowing only partial overlap between aligned slices and/or
              slice-specific cell types. PASTE2 formulates a novel partial fused
              Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport problem, which we solve using
              a conditional gradient algorithm. PASTE2 includes a model
              selection procedure to estimate the fraction of overlap between
              slices, and optionally uses information from histological images
              that accompany some SRT experiments. We show on both simulated and
              real data that PASTE2 obtains more accurate alignments than
              existing methods. We further use PASTE2 to reconstruct a 3D map of
              gene expression in a Drosophila embryo from a 16 slice Stereo-seq
              data set. PASTE2 produces accurate alignments of multislice data
              sets from multiple SRT technologies, enabling detailed studies of

              However, the experimental design choice of which regions of a

              hybridization approach, together with analytical tools, to study
              inflammatory gene expression in the larval zebrafish tailfin in
              response to a bath of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We use this model
              system to address whether spatial structure emerges in the tissue
              response even absent the spatial variation introduced by a
              pathogen. We find that epithelial cells in the tailfin express
              several pro-inflammatory genes, and that across these genes, the
              uniform stimulus triggers a spatially non-uniform response. We use
              a graph-based spectral decomposition method to analyze its

              cells are important producers of pro-inflammatory effector

              such as capturing gene co-expression modules, condition-specific
              enrichment and perturbation-specific gene-gene interactions. Then
              we showcase the broad utility of gene representations derived from
              GSPA, including for cell-cell communication (GSPA-LR), spatial

              profiling of ∼900 neuroanatomically precise subdivisions in two

               changes in single-cell in different spatial locations of the

               the effects of gene expression regulation on learning and memory
               mechanisms. Here, we obtained 74 single-cell samples from
               different spatial locations in a mouse hippocampus through
               microdissection technology, and used single-cell RNA-sequencing
               and spatial transcriptome sequencing to visualize and quantify
               the single-cell transcriptome features of tissue sections. The

              Here, we introduce the Visium HD platform (10x Genomics) and use
              it to investigate human CRC and normal adjacent mucosal tissues
              from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples. The first
              assay available on Visium HD is a probe-based spatial
              transcriptomics workflow that was developed to enable whole
              transcriptome single cell scale analysis. We demonstrate highly
              refined unsupervised spatial clustering in Visium HD data that
              aligns with the hallmarks of colon tissue morphology and is
              notably improved over earlier Visium assays. Using serial sections
              from the same FFPE blocks we generate a single cell atlas of our
              samples, then we integrate the data to comprehensively
              characterize the immune cell types present in the TME,
              specifically at the tumor periphery. We observed enrichment of two
              pro-tumor macrophage subpopulations with differential gene
              expression profiles that were localized within distinct tumor
              regions. Further characterization of the T cells present in one of
              the samples revealed a clonal expansion that we were able to
              localize in the tissue using in situ gene expression analysis. In
              situ analysis also allowed us to perform in-depth characterization
              of the microenvironment of the clonally expanded T cell population

              the CRC TME and identifies phenotypically and spatially distinct
              immune cell populations within it. We show that the single
              cell-scale resolution afforded by Visium HD and the whole
              transcriptome nature of the assay allows investigations into

              by how they interact with the tumor microenvironment and their

              each platform better suits the needs of its users. Here we compare
              the results obtained using 5 different spatial transcriptomics
              (VISIUM, VISIUM CytAssist, VisiumHD, Xenium, and CosMx) and one

              of the most common forms of the disease (lung, breast, colorectal,
              bladder, lymphoma and ovary). We observed that the VISIUM platform
              with CytAssist chemistry yielded superior data quality than manual
              VISIUM. On the other hand, Xenium consistently produced more
              reliable results for in situ platforms, with better gene
              clustering and fewer false positives than CosMx. Importantly,
              these platform-based variations didn't significantly affect cell
              type identification. VisiumHD offers the best options of both
              worlds, with subcellular resolution and whole-transcriptome
              coverage, albeit with some limitations that need to be accounted
              for in downstream analyses. Finally, by comparing VISIUM protein
              profiles with the spatial transcriptomics data from all four
              platforms on each sample, we identified several genes with
              mismatched RNA and protein expression patterns, highlighting the

              transcriptomics platforms are among the most advanced, allowing
              researchers to characterize the expression of thousands of genes
              across space. These new technologies are transforming our
              understanding of how cells are organized in space and communicate
              with each other to determine emergent phenotypes. This is
              particularly important in cancer research, as tumor evolution is
              shaped not only by the genetic properties of cancer cells but also
              by how they interact with the tumor microenvironment and their
              spatial organization. While many platforms can generate spatial
              transcriptomics profiles, it is still unclear in which context
              each platform better suits the needs of its users. Here we compare
              the results obtained using 5 different spatial transcriptomics
              (VISIUM, VISIUM CytAssist, VisiumHD, Xenium, and CosMx) and one
              spatial proteomics (VISIUM CytAssist) platforms across serial
              sections of 6 FFPE samples from primary human tumors covering some
              of the most common forms of the disease (lung, breast, colorectal,
              bladder, lymphoma and ovary). We observed that the VISIUM platform
              with CytAssist chemistry yielded superior data quality than manual
              VISIUM. On the other hand, Xenium consistently produced more
              reliable results for in situ platforms, with better gene
              clustering and fewer false positives than CosMx. Importantly,
              these platform-based variations didn't significantly affect cell
              type identification. VisiumHD offers the best options of both
              worlds, with subcellular resolution and whole-transcriptome
              coverage, albeit with some limitations that need to be accounted
              for in downstream analyses. Finally, by comparing VISIUM protein
              profiles with the spatial transcriptomics data from all four
              platforms on each sample, we identified several genes with
              mismatched RNA and protein expression patterns, highlighting the

               numerous unique challenges, such as rapid urbanization,
               significant regional disparities, high natural resource
               consumption, severe environmental pollution, and difficulties in
               unified governance, all of which exacerbate the vulnerability of
               China's urban ecosystems. In order to investigate the urban
               ecological resilience (UER) in China, this study integrates
               natural factors into the ecological resilience assessment
               framework to evaluate UER in China. Using social network analysis
               based on a modified gravity model, the network structure
               characteristics of UER in China was assessed and the formation
               mechanism of spatial association networks was further explored,
               aiming to identify ecological vulnerabilities and resilient
               areas. The results indicate: (1) UER shows distinct regional
               differentiation, with a spatial distribution pattern exhibiting a
               gradient of decreasing values from east to west. In particular,
               economically developed areas in the eastern coastal regions show
               significant “radiation effects” in spatial associations, playing
               a “central” role in improving the overall UER of the region. (2)
               The overall network of UER is complex, but the network density is
               relatively low. The inter‐regional connections and collaborative
               efforts in enhancing UER need to be strengthened. (3) Economic
               development level, innovation capacity, industrial structure, and
               geographical distance disparities in energy consumption
               significantly influenced the formation of spatial connections in
               UER across the nation. This study demonstrates the importance of
               strengthening inter‐regional coordination and cooperation to
               enhance UER, providing empirical insights for the achievement of
               global sustainable development goals.",

  abstract = "Treatment resistance in glioblastoma (GBM) is largely driven by
              the extensive multi-level heterogeneity that typifies this
              disease. Despite significant progress toward elucidating GBM's
              genomic and transcriptional heterogeneity, a critical knowledge
              gap remains in defining this heterogeneity at the spatial level.
              To address this, we employed spatial transcriptomics to map the
              architecture of the GBM ecosystem. This revealed tumor cell states
              that are jointly defined by gene expression and spatial
              localization, and multicellular niches whose composition varies
              along the tumor core-edge axis. Ligand-receptor interaction
              analysis uncovered a complex network of intercellular
              communication, including niche- and region-specific interactions.
              Finally, we found that CD8 positive GZMK positive T cells
              colocalize with LYVE1 positive CD163 positive myeloid cells in
              vascular regions, suggesting a potential mechanism for immune
              evasion. These findings provide novel insights into the GBM tumor
              microenvironment, highlighting previously unrecognized patterns of

              therapeutic avenues to disrupt tumor-promoting interactions and

               spatially resolved transcriptomics from 55 samples of primary
               tumour and metastases (liver, lung and peritoneum) collected from
               rapid autopsies of 13 people. We observe discernible
               transcriptomic shifts in cancer-cell lineage states as tumours
               transition from primary sites to organ-specific metastases, with
               the most pronounced intra-patient distinctions between liver and
               lung. Phylogenetic trees constructed from inferred copy number

              immune cells in response to ICB treatment need to be better
              characterized. Methods: Here, we perform a systematic evaluation
              of cell interactions between immune cell types within the tumor
              microenvironment using spatial omics data using complementary
              techniques from both 10X Visium spot-based spatial transcriptomics
              and Nanostring CosMx single-cell spatial omics with RNA gene panel

              neighborhoods of co-localizing cell types in single-cell spatial
              transcriptomics and proteomics data. In addition, we used both

              identify spatially constrained Ligand-Receptor interactions in
              Responder patients. Results: With 522,399 single cells profiled
              with both RNA and protein from 26 patients, in addition to
              spot-resolved spatial RNA-Seq from 8 patients treated with ICB
              together with bioinformatics analysis of publicly available
              single-cell and bulk RNA-Seq, we have identified a spatial and

              retrospective analyses. However, few clinical trials have tested
              their value prospectively. The DUTRENEO trial (EudraCT:
              2017-002246-6) investigated whether an 18-gene Tumour Inflammation
              Signature (TIS) that can robustly identify patients who respond to
              ICI in multiple tumour types could stratify patients with
              localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) to receive
              neoadjuvant ICI (durvalumab+tremelimumab) or standard
              cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Patients with
              TIS-high tumors were randomized to ICI or NAC, while patients with
              TIS-low tumors received NAC. A total of 73 patients were treated.
              Pathological complete response (pCR) rates were 38.5\% (TIS-High,
              ICI), 30\% (TIS-High, NAC), and 55\% (TIS-Low, NAC) (p = 0.349),
              indicating that - as applied - the TIS score did not significantly
              enrich in responders to ICI. Post-hoc analysis showed that higher
              TIS thresholds improved prediction of response to ICI but excluded
              many responders. Multi-omics analyses of pre-treatment samples,
              including whole-exome sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing, and spatial
              transcriptomics (Visium, Xenium), revealed that bulk RNA response
              signatures originated mainly from cancer cells. Spatial
              transcriptomics showed that ICI response was associated with
              proximity between cancer cells and adaptive immune cells, while
              resistance to NAC was linked to phenotypic plasticity of cancer
              cells despite low genetic diversity. The unique design of the
              DUTRENEO trial underscores the challenges of translating
              retrospective biomarkers into clinical practice and highlights the
              importance of spatial features in understanding tumour-immune
              interactions. These findings suggest that integrating spatial and
              multi-modal biomarkers in well-designed clinical trials could
