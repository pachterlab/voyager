               Waldh{\"o}r's indexes. We conclude also that the test proposed

               disadvantages when the interest is solely on the spatial
               correlation of morbidity risks. In this latter case, we
               recommend using our proposed test which is more powerful than

  author   = "Luo, Qing and Griffith, Daniel A and Wu, Huayi",
  abstract = "Being a hot topic in recent years, many studies have been
              conducted with spatial data containing massive numbers of
              observations. Because initial developments for classical spatial
              autocorrelation statistics are based on rather small sample
              sizes, in the context of massive spatial datasets, this paper
              presents extensions to efficiency and statistical power
              comparisons between the Moran coefficient and the Geary ratio for
              different variable distribution assumptions and selected
              geographic neighborhood definitions. The question addressed asks
              whether or not earlier results for small n extend to large and
              massively large n, especially for non-normal variables;
              implications established are relevant to big spatial data. To
              achieve these comparisons, this paper summarizes proofs of
              limiting variances, also called asymptotic variances, to do the
              efficiency analysis, and derives the relationship function
              between the two statistics to compare their statistical power at
              the same scale. Visualization of this statistical power analysis
              employs an alternative technique that already appears in the
              literature, furnishing additional understanding and clarity about
              these spatial autocorrelation statistics. Results include: the
              Moran coefficient is more efficient than the Geary ratio for most
              surface partitionings, because this index has a relatively
              smaller asymptotic as well as exact variance, and the superior
              power of the Moran coefficient vis-{\`a}-vis the Geary ratio for
              positive spatial autocorrelation depends upon the type of
              geographic configuration, with this power approaching one as
              sample sizes become increasingly large. Because spatial analysts
              usually calculate these two statistics for interval/ration data,
              this paper also includes comments about the join count statistics

              econometrics include the Moran Coefficient (MC), the Geary Ratio,
              (GR) and the join count statistics (JCS). Properties of these
              first two quantities rely on spatial weights matrix definitions
              [e.g., binary 0--1 (rook or queen adjacencies), nearest
              neighbors, inverse inter-point distance, row standardized], which
              may cause confusion about output from different software
              packages; to date, JCS calculations have been using only binary
              0--1 definitions. The MC and GR expected values for linear
              regression residuals also merit closer examination; although the
              mean and other details of the sampling distribution for the MC
              are well-known, at least the details of those for the GR are not.
              The (MC + GR) sum furnishes a potential diagnostic for
              georeferenced data normality, one that warrants much further
              explication and scrutiny. The Moran scatterplot is a widely used
              graphic tool for visualizing SA; this paper formally introduces
              its Geary scatterplot counterpart (first appearing informally in
              2019), together with some comparisons of the two. Meanwhile,
              established relationships between the JCS and the MC and the GR
              need additional inspection, too, especially in terms of their
              sampling variances. Preliminary analyses summarized in this paper
              also address derived asymptotic properties as well as links with
              the single spatial autoregressive parameter of the simultaneous
              autoregressive (SAR; spatial error) and autoregressive response
              (AR; spatial lag) model specifications. This paper describes
              selected little-known features of these standard SA indices,
              furthering a better understanding of, and a more complete set of
              details about, them. Results from a myriad of empirical spatial
              economics landscapes [e.g., Puerto Rico, Jiangsu Province, Texas,
              Houston (Harris County), and the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW)
              metroplex] and a variety of planar surface partitionings
              (including the square and hexagonal tessellations, and randomly
              generated graphs) illustrate highlighted theoretical and
              conceptual traits. These include a corroboration of the
              contention in the literature that the MC more closely aligns with

               Several aspects however potentially introduce noise in the NDVI

               AVHRR GIMMS NDVI exhibits a regression slope range in better
               agreement with Terra MODIS NDVI for semi-arid areas. However,

              transcripts from multiple cell types. Here, we introduce a
              statistical method, cell type-specific inference of differential
              expression (C-SIDE), that identifies cell type-specific DE in
              spatial transcriptomics, accounting for localization of other
              cell types. We model gene expression as an additive mixture
              across cell types of log-linear cell type-specific expression
              functions. C-SIDE's framework applies to many contexts: DE due to
              pathology, anatomical regions, cell-to-cell interactions and
              cellular microenvironment. Furthermore, C-SIDE enables
              statistical inference across multiple/replicates. Simulations and
              validation experiments on Slide-seq, MERFISH and Visium datasets
              demonstrate that C-SIDE accurately identifies DE with valid
              uncertainty quantification. Last, we apply C-SIDE to identify
              plaque-dependent immune activity in Alzheimer's disease and
              cellular interactions between tumor and immune cells. We
              distribute C-SIDE within the R package

  abstract = "Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used to analyze
              high-dimensional count data because, in contrast to real-valued
              alternatives such as factor analysis, it produces an
              interpretable parts-based representation. However, in
              applications such as spatial transcriptomics, NMF fails to
              incorporate known structure between observations. Here, we
              present nonnegative spatial factorization (NSF), a
              spatially-aware probabilistic dimension reduction model based on
              transformed Gaussian processes that naturally encourages sparsity
              and scales to tens of thousands of observations. NSF recovers
              ground truth factors more accurately than real-valued
              alternatives such as MEFISTO in simulations, and has lower
              out-of-sample prediction error than probabilistic NMF on three
              spatial transcriptomics datasets from mouse brain and liver.
              Since not all patterns of gene expression have spatial
              correlations, we also propose a hybrid extension of NSF that
              combines spatial and nonspatial components, enabling
              quantification of spatial importance for both observations and
              features. A TensorFlow implementation of NSF is available from

              recent technologies provide a much denser spot placement leading

              methods is cell segmentation and the assignment of spots to

              transcriptomics cell segmentation (SCS), which combines imaging
              data with sequencing data to improve cell segmentation accuracy.
              SCS assigns spots to cells by adaptively learning the position of

              large-scale integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomic

              consensus annotation, and analysis of 23 newly collected scRNAseq
              datasets and 88 publicly available single-cell (scRNAseq) and
              single-nucleus (snRNAseq) RNA-sequencing datasets. The resulting
              dataset includes more than 365,000 cells and spans a wide range

              provides a useful non-parametric approach for modelling temporal
              or spatial changes in gene expression. However, currently
              available GP regression methods that implement negative binomial
              likelihood models do not scale to the increasingly large datasets
              being produced by single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.
              RESULTS: The GPcounts package implements GP regression methods
              for modelling counts data using a negative binomial likelihood
              function. Computational efficiency is achieved through the use of
              variational Bayesian inference. The GP function models changes in
              the mean of the negative binomial likelihood through a
              logarithmic link function and the dispersion parameter is fitted
              by maximum likelihood. We validate the method on simulated time
              course data, showing better performance to identify changes in
              over-dispersed counts data than methods based on Gaussian or
              Poisson likelihoods. To demonstrate temporal inference, we apply
              GPcounts to single-cell RNA-seq datasets after pseudotime and
              branching inference. To demonstrate spatial inference, we apply
              GPcounts to data from the mouse olfactory bulb to identify
              spatially variable genes and compare to two published GP methods.
              We also provide the option of modelling additional dropout using
              a zero-inflated negative binomial. Our results show that GPcounts
              can be used to model temporal and spatial counts data in cases
              where simpler Gaussian and Poisson likelihoods are unrealistic.

              further analysis is not a straightforward process. Biases,
              artifacts and other sources of unwanted variation are present in
              the data, requiring substantial time and effort to be spent on
              pre-processing, quality control (QC) and normalization. RESULTS:
              We have developed the R/Bioconductor package scater to facilitate
              rigorous pre-processing, quality control, normalization and
              visualization of scRNA-seq data. The package provides a
              convenient, flexible workflow to process raw sequencing reads
              into a high-quality expression dataset ready for downstream
              analysis. scater provides a rich suite of plotting tools for
              single-cell data and a flexible data structure that is compatible

              In biology, single-cell expression studies almost always begin
              with reduction to two or three dimensions to produce `all-in-one'
              visuals of the data that are amenable to the human eye, and these
              are subsequently used for qualitative and quantitative analysis

              practical implications of low-dimensional embedding of
              single-cell data, and find extensive distortions incurred on the

              current methods do not sufficiently explore the expressiveness of
              the multi-modal SRT data, leaving a large room for improvement of
              performance. Moreover, the current deep learning based methods
              lack interpretability due to the ``black box'' nature, impeding
              its further applications in the areas that require explanation.
              Results We propose conST, a powerful and flexible SRT data
              analysis framework utilizing contrastive learning techniques.
              conST can learn low-dimensional embeddings by effectively
              integrating multi-modal SRT data, i . e . gene expression,
              spatial information, and morphology (if applicable). The learned
              embeddings can be then used for various downstream tasks,
              including clustering, trajectory and pseudotime inference,
              cell-to-cell interaction, etc . Extensive experiments in various
              datasets have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and
              robustness of the proposed conST, achieving up to 10\%
              improvement in clustering ARI in the commonly used benchmark

              paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human breast cancer sections using a
              novel FFPE-compatible single cell gene expression workflow
              (Chromium Fixed RNA Profiling; scFFPE-seq), spatial
              transcriptomics (Visium CytAssist), and automated
              microscopy-based in situ technology using a 313-plex gene panel
              (Xenium In Situ). Whole transcriptome profiling of the FFPE
              tissue using scFFPE-seq and Visium facilitated the identification
              of 17 different cell types. Xenium allowed us to spatially
              resolve these cell types and their gene expression profiles with
              single cell resolution. Due to the non-destructive nature of the
              Xenium workflow, we were able to perform H\&E staining and
              immunofluorescence on the same section post-processing which
              allowed us to spatially register protein, histological, and RNA
              data together into a single image. Integration of data from
              Chromium scFFPE-seq, Visium, and Xenium across serial sections
              allowed us to do extensive benchmarking of sensitivity and
              specificity between the technologies. Furthermore, data
              integration inspired the interrogation of three molecularly
              distinct tumor subtypes (low-grade and high-grade ductal
              carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and invasive carcinoma). We used Xenium
              to characterize the cellular composition and differentially
              expressed genes within these subtypes. This analysis allowed us
              to draw biological insights about DCIS progression to
              infiltrating carcinoma, as the myoepithelial layer degrades and
              tumor cells invade the surrounding stroma. Xenium also allowed us
              to further predict the hormone receptor status of tumor subtypes,
              including a small 0.1 mm2 DCIS region that was triple positive
              for ESR1 (estrogen receptor), PGR (progesterone receptor) and
              ERBB2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, a.k.a. HER2)
              RNA. In order to derive whole transcriptome information about
              these cells, we used Xenium data to interpolate the cell
              composition of Visium spots, and leveraged Visium whole
              transcriptome information to discover new biomarkers of breast
              tumor subtypes. We demonstrate that scFFPE-seq, Visium, and
              Xenium independently provide information about molecular
              signatures relevant to understanding cancer heterogeneity.

              throughput and spatial resolution of measurements, resulting in
              larger datasets. The added spatial dimension and volume of
              measurements poses an analytics challenge that has, in the
              short-term, been addressed by adopting methods designed for the
              analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. Though these methods work
              well in some cases, not all necessarily translate appropriately
              to spatial technologies. A common assumption is that total
              sequencing depth, also known as library size, represents
              technical variation in single-cell RNA-seq technologies, and this
              is often normalised out during analysis. Through analysis of
              several different spatial datasets, we noted that this assumption
              does not necessarily hold in spatial molecular data. To formally
              assess this, we explore the relationship between library size and
              independently annotated spatial regions, across 23 samples from 4
              different spatial technologies with varying throughput and
              spatial resolution. We found that library size confounded biology
              across all technologies, regardless of the tissue being
              investigated. Statistical modelling of binned total transcripts
              shows that tissue region is strongly associated with library size
              across all technologies, even after accounting for cell density
              of the bins. Through a benchmarking experiment, we show that
              normalising out library size leads to sub-optimal spatial domain
              identification using common graph-based clustering algorithms. On
              average, better clustering was achieved when library size effects
              were not normalised out explicitly, especially with data from the
              newer sub-cellular localised technologies. Taking these results
              into consideration, we recommend that spatial data should not be
              specifically corrected for library size prior to analysis unless
              strongly motivated. We also emphasise that spatial data are
              different to single-cell RNA-seq and care should be taken when
              adopting algorithms designed for single cell data. \#\#\#

               in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial evaluation of

               expressed in the geographic information system literature

               various geographic literatures concerned with spatial

               the three largest eigenvalues of a binary geographic weights
               matrix have natural interpretations. A second question asks
               whether or not the eigenvalues of a geographic weights matrix
               prove useful in understanding the sampling distribution for
               spatial autocorrelation in a given geographic landscape. A third
               question addresses the issue of spatial autocorrelation
               components of geo-refer-enced phenomena. The analysis summarized
               in this paper documents responses to these three questions.

               understanding the ecological processes structuring the
               distribution of organisms. Spatial patterns in species
               distributions result from a combination of several processes
               occuring at different scales: identifying these scales is thus a
               crucial issue. Recent studies have proposed a new family of
               spatial predictors (PCNM: principal coordinates of neighbours
               matrices; MEMs: Moran's eigenvectors maps) that allow for
               modelling of spatial variation on different scales. To assess
               the multi-scale spatial patterns in multivariate data, these
               variables are often used as predictors in constrained ordination
               methods. However, the selection of the appropriate spatial
               predictors is still troublesome, and the identification of the
               main scales of spatial variation remains an open question. This
               paper presents a new statistical tool to tackle this issue: the
               multi-scale pattern analysis (MSPA). This ordination method uses
               MEMs to decompose ecological variability into several spatial
               scales and then summarizes this decomposition using graphical
               representations. A canonical form of MSPA can also be used to
               assess the spatial scales of the species-environment
               relationships. MSPA is compared to constrained ordination using
               simulated data, and illustrated using the famous oribatid mites

              used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes,
              for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an
              intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to
              external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and
              for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks
              facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used
              to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These
              methods have been successfully applied in various biological
              contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and
              analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation
              network methodology have been described in separate publications,
              there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and
              consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.
              RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive
              collection of R functions for performing various aspects of
              weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes
              functions for network construction, module detection, gene
              selection, calculations of topological properties, data
              simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external
              software. Along with the R package we also present R software
              tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene
              expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be
              applied to a variety of different settings. CONCLUSION: The WGCNA
              package provides R functions for weighted correlation network
              analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression
              data. The R package along with its source code and additional

              tissue sections collected from a larger tissue sample. The
              two-dimensional nature of this data requires multiple consecutive

              comprehensive three-dimensional map of the tissue. However, there

              together in 3D to create a holistic view of the tissue. RESULTS:
              We have developed an R package named STUtility that takes 10x
              Genomics Visium data as input and provides features to perform
              standardized data transformations, alignment of multiple tissue
              sections, regional annotation, and visualizations of the combined

               are represented, coordinate reference systems (projections,
               datums), the fact that the Earth is round and its consequences
               for analysis, and how attributes of geometries can relate to
               geometries. In the second part of the book, these concepts are
               illustrated with data science examples using the R language. In
               the third part, statistical modelling approaches are
               demonstrated using real world data examples. After reading this
               book, the reader will be well equipped to avoid a number of
               major spatial data analysis errors. The book gives a detailed
               explanation of the core spatial software packages for R: sf for
               simple feature access, and stars for raster and vector data
               cubes -- array data with spatial and temporal dimensions. It
               also shows how geometrical operations change when going from a
               flat space to the surface of a sphere, which is what sf and
               stars use when coordinates are not projected (degrees
               longitude/latitude). Separate chapters detail a variety of
               plotting approaches for spatial maps using R, and different ways

               propose a multivariate spatial analysis based on Moran's I
               (MULTISPATI) by introducing a row-sum standardized spatial
               weight matrix in the statistical triplet notation. This
               analysis, which is a generalization of Wartenberg's approach to
               multivariate spatial correlation, would imply a compromise
               between the relations among many variables (multivariate
               analysis) and their spatial structure (autocorrelation).
               MULTISPATI approach is very flexible and can handle various
               kinds of data (quantitative and/or qualitative data, contingency
               tables). A study is presented to illustrate the method using a
               spatial version of Correspondence Analysis. Location: Territoire
               d'Etude et d'Experimentation de TroisFontaines (eastern France).
               Results: Ordination of vegetation plots by this spatial analysis
               is quite robust with reference to rare species and highlights
               spatial patterns related to soil properties.",

               autocorrelation quantification, the popular form of
               georeferenced variables studied, and the presence of both hidden
               negative spatial autocorrelation, and mixtures of positive and
               negative spatial autocorrelation in georeferenced variables.
               This paper also presents details and insights by furnishing
               concrete empirical examples of negative spatial autocorrelation.
               These examples include: Multi-locational chain store market

               global appeal and general circulation. With these new unabridged
               softcover volumes, Wiley hopes to extend the lives of these
               works by making them available to future generations of
               statisticians, mathematicians, and scientists. Spatial
               statistics --- analyzing spatial data through statistical models
               --- has proven exceptionally versatile, encompassing problems
               ranging from the microscopic to the astronomic. However, for the
               scientist and engineer faced only with scattered and uneven
               treatments of the subject in the scientific literature, learning
               how to make practical use of spatial statistics in day-to-day
               analytical work is very difficult. Designed exclusively for
               scientists eager to tap into the enormous potential of this
               analytical tool and upgrade their range of technical skills,
               Statistics for Spatial Data is a comprehensive, single-source
               guide to both the theory and applied aspects of spatial
               statistical methods. The hard-cover edition was hailed by
               Mathematical Reviews as an ``excellent book which will become a
               basic reference.'' This paper-back edition of the 1993 edition,
               is designed to meet the many technological challenges facing the
               scientist and engineer. Concentrating on the three areas of
               geostatistical data, lattice data, and point patterns, the book
               sheds light on the link between data and model, revealing how
               design, inference, and diagnostics are an outgrowth of that
               link. It then explores new methods to reveal just how spatial
               statistical models can be used to solve important problems in a
               host of areas in science and engineering. Discussion includes:
               Exploratory spatial data analysis Spectral theory for stationary
               processes Spatial scale Simulation methods for spatial processes
               Spatial bootstrapping Statistical image analysis and remote
               sensing Computational aspects of model fitting Application of
               models to disease mapping Designed to accommodate the practical
               needs of the professional, it features a unified and common

               into the text, numerous illustrations (including graphs that
               illuminate the theory discussed) and over 1,000 references.
               Fully balancing theory with applications, Statistics for Spatial
               Data, Revised Edition is an exceptionally clear guide on making
               optimal use of one of the ascendant analytical tools of the
