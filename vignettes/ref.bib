               recording geographical data in this fashion is increasingly
               popular today. One of the motivations for the use of such
               partitionings is their `objectivity'. It is also asserted that
               there are advantages for analysis purposes over the irregular
               spatial polygons defined by political jurisdictions. There is no
               doubt that there are notational simplifications; one can index a
               cell of an array in the same fashion as in matrix algebra. Thus
               the cell in the ith row and jth column becomes the cell i,j.
               Geographical data which pertain to that cell can be referred to
               by subscripts, as gijfor example. If one lets G represent an N by

               a portion of the surface of the earth (if one deletes the poles

               matrix algebra to this array and can obtain geographically
               interesting results. The major advantage however is pedagogical,
               and results from the fact that in such a scheme every country in
               the world has exactly the same number of neighbors. The
               analytical results can be extended to the more realistic
               variable-number-of-neighbors case but the insight is more easily

              conducted with spatial data containing massive numbers of
              observations. Because initial developments for classical spatial
              autocorrelation statistics are based on rather small sample sizes,
              in the context of massive spatial datasets, this paper presents
              extensions to efficiency and statistical power comparisons between
              the Moran coefficient and the Geary ratio for different variable
              distribution assumptions and selected geographic neighborhood
              definitions. The question addressed asks whether or not earlier
              results for small n extend to large and massively large n,
              especially for non-normal variables; implications established are
              relevant to big spatial data. To achieve these comparisons, this
              paper summarizes proofs of limiting variances, also called
              asymptotic variances, to do the efficiency analysis, and derives
              the relationship function between the two statistics to compare
              their statistical power at the same scale. Visualization of this
              statistical power analysis employs an alternative technique that
              already appears in the literature, furnishing additional
              understanding and clarity about these spatial autocorrelation
              statistics. Results include: the Moran coefficient is more
              efficient than the Geary ratio for most surface partitionings,
              because this index has a relatively smaller asymptotic as well as
              exact variance, and the superior power of the Moran coefficient
              vis-à-vis the Geary ratio for positive spatial autocorrelation
              depends upon the type of geographic configuration, with this power
              approaching one as sample sizes become increasingly large. Because

              econometrics include the Moran Coefficient (MC), the Geary Ratio,

              first two quantities rely on spatial weights matrix definitions
              [e.g., binary 0--1 (rook or queen adjacencies), nearest neighbors,
              inverse inter-point distance, row standardized], which may cause
              confusion about output from different software packages; to date,
              JCS calculations have been using only binary 0--1 definitions. The
              MC and GR expected values for linear regression residuals also
              merit closer examination; although the mean and other details of
              the sampling distribution for the MC are well-known, at least the
              details of those for the GR are not. The (MC + GR) sum furnishes a
              potential diagnostic for georeferenced data normality, one that
              warrants much further explication and scrutiny. The Moran
              scatterplot is a widely used graphic tool for visualizing SA; this
              paper formally introduces its Geary scatterplot counterpart (first
              appearing informally in 2019), together with some comparisons of
              the two. Meanwhile, established relationships between the JCS and
              the MC and the GR need additional inspection, too, especially in
              terms of their sampling variances. Preliminary analyses summarized
              in this paper also address derived asymptotic properties as well
              as links with the single spatial autoregressive parameter of the
              simultaneous autoregressive (SAR; spatial error) and
              autoregressive response (AR; spatial lag) model specifications.
              This paper describes selected little-known features of these

              and randomly generated graphs) illustrate highlighted theoretical
              and conceptual traits. These include a corroboration of the
              contention in the literature that the MC more closely aligns with

               channels 1 and 2 spectral response functions from SPOT VGT1 to
               SPOT VGT2 in 2003. Trend analysis of AVHRR GIMMS NDVI exhibits a
               regression slope range in better agreement with Terra MODIS NDVI

              subcellular resolution. A key challenge for these newer methods is
              cell segmentation and the assignment of spots to cells.
              Traditional image-based segmentation methods are limited and do
              not make full use of the information profiled by spatial
              transcriptomics. Here we present subcellular spatial
              transcriptomics cell segmentation (SCS), which combines imaging
              data with sequencing data to improve cell segmentation accuracy.
              SCS assigns spots to cells by adaptively learning the position of
              each spot relative to the center of its cell using a transformer
              neural network. SCS was tested on two new subcellular spatial
              transcriptomics technologies and outperformed traditional
              image-based segmentation methods. SCS achieved better accuracy,
              identified more cells and provided more realistic cell size
              estimation. Subcellular analysis of RNAs using SCS spot
              assignments provides information on RNA localization and further
              supports the segmentation results.",

              large-scale integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomic
              data can overcome these limitations. We created a single-cell
              transcriptomic dataset of mouse skeletal muscle by integration,
              consensus annotation, and analysis of 23 newly collected scRNAseq
              datasets and 88 publicly available single-cell (scRNAseq) and
              single-nucleus (snRNAseq) RNA-sequencing datasets. The resulting
              dataset includes more than 365,000 cells and spans a wide range of

              identify genes with spatially variable expression patterns, or

              neighboring cells into nodes, and then uses a Gaussian process to
              fit the node-level spatial gene expression to identify SVgenes.
              Experiments show that SOMDE is about 5-50 times faster than
              existing methods with comparable results. The adjustable

              provides a useful non-parametric approach for modelling temporal
              or spatial changes in gene expression. However, currently
              available GP regression methods that implement negative binomial
              likelihood models do not scale to the increasingly large datasets
              being produced by single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.
              RESULTS: The GPcounts package implements GP regression methods for
              modelling counts data using a negative binomial likelihood
              function. Computational efficiency is achieved through the use of
              variational Bayesian inference. The GP function models changes in
              the mean of the negative binomial likelihood through a logarithmic
              link function and the dispersion parameter is fitted by maximum
              likelihood. We validate the method on simulated time course data,
              showing better performance to identify changes in over-dispersed
              counts data than methods based on Gaussian or Poisson likelihoods.
              To demonstrate temporal inference, we apply GPcounts to
              single-cell RNA-seq datasets after pseudotime and branching
              inference. To demonstrate spatial inference, we apply GPcounts to
              data from the mouse olfactory bulb to identify spatially variable
              genes and compare to two published GP methods. We also provide the
              option of modelling additional dropout using a zero-inflated
              negative binomial. Our results show that GPcounts can be used to
              model temporal and spatial counts data in cases where simpler

              technologies have achieved subcellular resolution, enabling
              detection of individual molecules in their native tissue context.
              Data associated with these technologies promise unprecedented
              opportunity toward understanding cellular and subcellular biology.
              However, in R/Bioconductor, there is a scarcity of existing
              computational infrastructure to represent such data, and
              particularly to summarize and transform it for existing widely
              adopted computational tools in single-cell transcriptomics
              analysis, including SingleCellExperiment and SpatialExperiment
              (SPE) classes. With the emergence of several commercial offerings
              of imaging-based ST, there is a pressing need to develop
              consistent data structure standards for these technologies at the
              individual molecule-level. RESULTS: To this end, we have developed
              MoleculeExperiment, an R/Bioconductor package, which (i) stores
              molecule and cell segmentation boundary information at the
              molecule-level, (ii) standardizes this molecule-level information
              across different imaging-based ST technologies, including
              10$\times$ Genomics' Xenium, and (iii) streamlines transition from
              a MoleculeExperiment object to a SpatialExperiment object.

              technologies for measuring gene expression on a genomic scale,
              without the need for prior knowledge of the genome sequence. As
              the cost of sequencing DNA decreases, the number of DGE datasets
              is expected to grow dramatically. Various tests of differential
              expression have been proposed for replicated DGE data using
              binomial, Poisson, negative binomial or pseudo-likelihood (PL)
              models for the counts, but none of the these are usable when the
              number of replicates is very small. RESULTS: We develop tests
              using the negative binomial distribution to model overdispersion
              relative to the Poisson, and use conditional weighted likelihood
              to moderate the level of overdispersion across genes. Not only is
              our strategy applicable even with the smallest number of

              strategies when more libraries are available. The methodology is

              In biology, single-cell expression studies almost always begin

              impressive power in yielding biological insights into
              neuroscience, disease study, and even plant biology. However,
              current methods do not sufficiently explore the expressiveness of
              the multi-modal SRT data, leaving a large room for improvement of
              performance. Moreover, the current deep learning based methods
              lack interpretability due to the ``black box'' nature, impeding
              its further applications in the areas that require explanation.
              Results We propose conST, a powerful and flexible SRT data
              analysis framework utilizing contrastive learning techniques.
              conST can learn low-dimensional embeddings by effectively
              integrating multi-modal SRT data, i . e . gene expression, spatial
              information, and morphology (if applicable). The learned
              embeddings can be then used for various downstream tasks,
              including clustering, trajectory and pseudotime inference,
              cell-to-cell interaction, etc . Extensive experiments in various
              datasets have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and
              robustness of the proposed conST, achieving up to 10\% improvement
              in clustering ARI in the commonly used benchmark dataset. We also
              show that the learned embedding can be used in complicated
              scenarios, such as predicting cancer progression by analyzing the
              tumour microenvironment and cell-to-cell interaction (CCI) of
              breast cancer. Our framework is interpretable in that it is able
              to find the correlated spots that support the clustering, which
              matches the CCI interaction pairs as well, providing more
              confidence to clinicians when making clinical decisions. \#\#\#

              that can be derived with its methods, such as biologically
              relevant negative spatial autocorrelation. Underlying Voyager is
              the SpatialFeatureExperiment data structure, which combines Simple

              Normalization of gene expression data is often needed to account
              for technical factors that may confound underlying biological
              signals. Here, we investigate the potential impact of different
              gene count normalization methods with different targeted gene
              panels in the analysis and interpretation of im-SRT data. Using
              different simulated gene panels that overrepresent genes expressed
              in specific tissue regions or cell types, we demonstrate how
              normalization methods based on detected gene counts per cell
              differentially impact normalized gene expression magnitudes in a
              region- or cell type-specific manner. We show that these
              normalization-induced effects may reduce the reliability of
              downstream analyses including differential gene expression, gene
              fold change, and spatially variable gene analysis, introducing

              not observed with normalization approaches that do not use
              detected gene counts for gene expression magnitude adjustment,
              such as with cell volume or cell area normalization. We recommend
              using non-gene count-based normalization approaches when feasible
              and evaluating gene panel representativeness before using gene

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in
              bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene
              co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for
              describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray
              samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used
              for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for
              summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an
              intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to
              external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and
              for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks
              facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used
              to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These
              methods have been successfully applied in various biological
              contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and
              analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation
              network methodology have been described in separate publications,
              there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and
              consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.
              RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive
              collection of R functions for performing various aspects of
              weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes
              functions for network construction, module detection, gene
              selection, calculations of topological properties, data
              simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software.
              Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials.
              While the methods development was motivated by gene expression
              data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a
              variety of different settings. CONCLUSION: The WGCNA package
              provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis,
              e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data. The R

              create a holistic view of the tissue. RESULTS: We have developed
              an R package named STUtility that takes 10x Genomics Visium data
              as input and provides features to perform standardized data

               datums), the fact that the Earth is round and its consequences
               for analysis, and how attributes of geometries can relate to
               geometries. In the second part of the book, these concepts are
               illustrated with data science examples using the R language. In
               the third part, statistical modelling approaches are demonstrated
               using real world data examples. After reading this book, the
               reader will be well equipped to avoid a number of major spatial
               data analysis errors. The book gives a detailed explanation of
               the core spatial software packages for R: sf for simple feature
               access, and stars for raster and vector data cubes -- array data
               with spatial and temporal dimensions. It also shows how

               been made more accessible to consumers in an effort to increase
               global appeal and general circulation. With these new unabridged
               softcover volumes, Wiley hopes to extend the lives of these works
               by making them available to future generations of statisticians,
               mathematicians, and scientists. Spatial statistics --- analyzing
               spatial data through statistical models --- has proven
               exceptionally versatile, encompassing problems ranging from the
               microscopic to the astronomic. However, for the scientist and
               engineer faced only with scattered and uneven treatments of the
               subject in the scientific literature, learning how to make
               practical use of spatial statistics in day-to-day analytical work
               is very difficult. Designed exclusively for scientists eager to
               tap into the enormous potential of this analytical tool and
               upgrade their range of technical skills, Statistics for Spatial
               Data is a comprehensive, single-source guide to both the theory
               and applied aspects of spatial statistical methods. The
               hard-cover edition was hailed by Mathematical Reviews as an
               ``excellent book which will become a basic reference.'' This
               paper-back edition of the 1993 edition, is designed to meet the
               many technological challenges facing the scientist and engineer.
               Concentrating on the three areas of geostatistical data, lattice
               data, and point patterns, the book sheds light on the link
               between data and model, revealing how design, inference, and
               diagnostics are an outgrowth of that link. It then explores new
               methods to reveal just how spatial statistical models can be used
               to solve important problems in a host of areas in science and
               engineering. Discussion includes: Exploratory spatial data
               analysis Spectral theory for stationary processes Spatial scale
               Simulation methods for spatial processes Spatial bootstrapping
               Statistical image analysis and remote sensing Computational
               aspects of model fitting Application of models to disease mapping
               Designed to accommodate the practical needs of the professional,
               it features a unified and common notation for its subject as well

               illustrations (including graphs that illuminate the theory
               discussed) and over 1,000 references. Fully balancing theory with
               applications, Statistics for Spatial Data, Revised Edition is an
               exceptionally clear guide on making optimal use of one of the
               ascendant analytical tools of the decade, one that has begun to

              across a whole tissue are revolutionizing the resolution of
              molecular states in clinical tissue samples. Commercially
              available methods that characterize either single cell or spatial
              gene expression are currently limited by low sample throughput
              and/or gene plexy, lack of on-instrument analysis, and the
              destruction of histological features and epitopes during the
              workflow. Here, we analyzed large, serial formalin-fixed,
              paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human breast cancer sections using a
              novel FFPE-compatible single cell gene expression workflow
              (Chromium Fixed RNA Profiling; scFFPE-seq), spatial
              transcriptomics (Visium CytAssist), and automated microscopy-based
              in situ technology using a 313-plex gene panel (Xenium In Situ).
              Whole transcriptome profiling of the FFPE tissue using scFFPE-seq
              and Visium facilitated the identification of 17 different cell
              types. Xenium allowed us to spatially resolve these cell types and
              their gene expression profiles with single cell resolution. Due to
              the non-destructive nature of the Xenium workflow, we were able to
              perform H\&E staining and immunofluorescence on the same section
              post-processing which allowed us to spatially register protein,
              histological, and RNA data together into a single image.
              Integration of data from Chromium scFFPE-seq, Visium, and Xenium
              across serial sections allowed us to do extensive benchmarking of
              sensitivity and specificity between the technologies. Furthermore,
              data integration inspired the interrogation of three molecularly
              distinct tumor subtypes (low-grade and high-grade ductal carcinoma
              in situ (DCIS), and invasive carcinoma). We used Xenium to
              characterize the cellular composition and differentially expressed
              genes within these subtypes. This analysis allowed us to draw
              biological insights about DCIS progression to infiltrating
              carcinoma, as the myoepithelial layer degrades and tumor cells
              invade the surrounding stroma. Xenium also allowed us to further
              predict the hormone receptor status of tumor subtypes, including a
              small 0.1 mm2 DCIS region that was triple positive for ESR1
              (estrogen receptor), PGR (progesterone receptor) and ERBB2 (human
              epidermal growth factor receptor 2, a.k.a. HER2) RNA. In order to
              derive whole transcriptome information about these cells, we used
              Xenium data to interpolate the cell composition of Visium spots,
              and leveraged Visium whole transcriptome information to discover
              new biomarkers of breast tumor subtypes. We demonstrate that
              scFFPE-seq, Visium, and Xenium independently provide information
              about molecular signatures relevant to understanding cancer
              heterogeneity. However, it is the integration of these
              technologies that leads to even deeper insights, ushering in
              discoveries that will progress oncology research and the
              development of diagnostics and therapeutics. \#\#\# Competing

  abstract = "Spatial molecular technologies have revolutionised the study of
              disease microenvironments by providing spatial context to tissue
              heterogeneity. Recent spatial technologies are increasing the
              throughput and spatial resolution of measurements, resulting in
              larger datasets. The added spatial dimension and volume of
              measurements poses an analytics challenge that has, in the
              short-term, been addressed by adopting methods designed for the
              analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. Though these methods work
              well in some cases, not all necessarily translate appropriately to
              spatial technologies. A common assumption is that total sequencing
              depth, also known as library size, represents technical variation
              in single-cell RNA-seq technologies, and this is often normalised
              out during analysis. Through analysis of several different spatial
              datasets, we noted that this assumption does not necessarily hold
              in spatial molecular data. To formally assess this, we explore the
              relationship between library size and independently annotated
              spatial regions, across 23 samples from 4 different spatial
              technologies with varying throughput and spatial resolution. We
              found that library size confounded biology across all
              technologies, regardless of the tissue being investigated.
              Statistical modelling of binned total transcripts shows that
              tissue region is strongly associated with library size across all
              technologies, even after accounting for cell density of the bins.
              Through a benchmarking experiment, we show that normalising out
              library size leads to sub-optimal spatial domain identification
              using common graph-based clustering algorithms. On average, better
              clustering was achieved when library size effects were not
              normalised out explicitly, especially with data from the newer
              sub-cellular localised technologies. Taking these results into
              consideration, we recommend that spatial data should not be
              specifically corrected for library size prior to analysis unless
              strongly motivated. We also emphasise that spatial data are
              different to single-cell RNA-seq and care should be taken when
              adopting algorithms designed for single cell data. \#\#\#

              single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq in 22 treatment-naive MBMs and 10
              extracranial melanoma metastases (ECMs) and matched spatial
              single-cell transcriptomics and T cell receptor (TCR)-seq. Cancer
              cells from MBM were more chromosomally unstable, adopted a

              expressed metabolic pathways. Key observations were validated in
              independent patient cohorts, patient-derived MBM/ECM xenograft
              models, RNA/ATAC-seq, proteomics, and multiplexed imaging.

              single-cell profiling. The practicality of assessing cellular

              RNAscope HiPlex, Molecular Cartography, MERFISH/Merscope, and
              Xenium – together with sequencing-basedST(Visium). These
              technologies were used to study cryosections of medulloblastoma
