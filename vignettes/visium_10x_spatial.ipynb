    "Now we have the tissue mask, which we will convert to polygon. While OpenCV can directly perform the conversion, as there isn't a comprehensive R wrapper of OpenCV, this conversion is more convoluted in R. We first convert the `Image` object to a raster as implemented in `terra`, the core R package for geospatial raster data. Then `terra` can convert the raster to polygon. As this image is downsized, the polygon will look quite pixelated. To mitigate this pixelation and save memory, the `ms_simplify()` function is used to simplify the polygon, only keeping a small proportion of all vertices. The `st_simplify()` function in `sf` can also simplify the polygons, but we can't specify what proportion of vertices to keep."
