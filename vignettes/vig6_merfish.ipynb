    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The `SpatialFeatureExperiment` (SFE) and `Voyager` packages were originally developed around a relatively small Visium dataset as a proof of concept, and were hence not originally optimized for very large datasets. However, larger smFISH datasets with hundreds of thousands, sometimes over a million cells have already been produced and will soon be produced routinely. Among studies using smFISH-based spatial transcriptomics technologies that reported the number of cells per dataset, the number of cells per dataset has increased in the past years [@Moses2022-xz].\n",

    "\n",
    "In anticipation of large datasets, this vignette was produced using limited GitHub Actions resources (MacOS), which are 14 GB of RAM with 3 CPU cores and 14 GB of disk space, comparable to laptops. We therefore expect that the analyses in this vignette should scale to reasonably sized datasets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we use in this vignette is a MERFISH mouse liver dataset downloaded from the [Vizgen website](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/vz-liver-showcase/Liver1Slice1). We will use it to discuss some issues with large datasets and some upcoming features in the next release of `Voyager`. The gene count matrix and cell metadata (including centroid coordinates) were downloaded as CSV files and read into R. While 7 z-planes were imaged, cell segmentation is only available in one z-plane. The cell polygons are in HDF5 files, with one HDF5 file per field of view (FOV), and there are over 1000 FOVs in this dataset. Converting these HDF5 files into an `sf` data frame is not trivial. See the [vignette on creating a `SpatialFeatureExperiment` (SFE) object](https://pachterlab.github.io/voyager/articles/create_sfe.html#technology-specific-notes) for code used to do the conversion, and the polygons are included in the SFE object. The cell metadata already has cell volume. If the polygons are not used in the analyses, and the polygons can't be seen on a static plot with hundreds of thousands of cells anyway, then doing the conversion is optional. While the transcript spot locations are available, we cannot yet work with such a large point dataset.\n",

    "The variogram rises when going beyond 2000 at 30 and 90 degrees and drops at 150 degrees. This is consistent with the variogram map. These differences are averaged out in the omni-directional variogram. `gstat` does not fit anisotropy parameters, so the fitted curve is omni-directional. It fits pretty well below 2000. This is only for nCounts, and may differ for other QC metrics and genes. What if anisotropy varies in space? A problem with the variogram is that it's global, giving one result for the entire dataset, albeit more nuanced than just a number as in Moran's I, because kriging assumes that the data is intrinsically stationary, meaning that the same variogram model applies everywhere, and that spatial dependence only depends on lag between two observations.\n",

However, the binned data is not in an SFE object. We are considering writing a method to spatially bin all cell level data in an SFE object. Here `gstat` is using `lattice`, a predecessor of `ggplot2` to make facetted plots and has been superseded by `ggplot2`. `gstat` is one of the oldest R packages still on CRAN, dating back to the days of S (prequel of R), although its oldest archive on CRAN is from 2003. `spdep` is also really old; its oldest archive on CRAN is from 2002, but it's still in active development. In using these time honored packages and methods (Moran's I and Geary's C themselves date back to the 1950s and their modern form date back to 1969 [@Cliff1969-wp; @Bivand2013-jx]) on the cool new spatial transcriptomics dataset, we are participating in a glorious tradition, which we will further develop as a spatial analysis tradition forms around spatial -omics data analysis.\n",

    "# PCA for larger datasets\n",
    "There are many ways to do PCA in R, and the [`BiocSingular`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BiocSingular.html) package makes a number of different methods available with a consistent user interface, and it supports out of memory data in `DelayedArray`. According to [this benchmark](https://slowkow.com/notes/pca-benchmark/), `stats::prcomp()` shipped with R is rather slow for larger datasets. The fastest methods are `irlba::irlba()` and `RSpectra::svds()`, and the former is supported by `BiocSingular`. So here we use IRLBA and see how long it takes. Many PCA algorithms involve repeated matrix multiplications. R does not come with optimized BLAS and LAPACK, for portability reasons. However, the BLAS and LAPACK used by R can be changed to an optimized one (here's [how to do it](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#Shared-BLAS)), which will speed up matrix multiplication.

    "PC1 and PC4 highlight the major blood vessels, while PC2 and PC3 have less spatial structure. While in the CosMX and Xenium datasets on this website, the top PCs have clear spatial structures despite the absence of spatial information in non-spatial PCA because of clear spatial compartments for some cell types, which does not seem to be the case in this dataset except for the blood vessels. We have seen above that some genes have strong spatial structures. There are some methods for spatially informed PCA, such as MULTISPATI PCA [@Dray2008-en] in the [`adespatial`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/adespatial/index.html) package, which seeks to maximize both variance (as in non-spatial PCA) and Moran's I on each PC. Unlike traditional PCs, where all eigenvalues, signifying variance explained, are positive, MULTISPATI PCA can have negative eigenvalues, which signify negative spatial autocorrelation. The PCs from MULTISPATI PCA with positive eigenvalues are also more spatially coherent than those from non-spatial PCA. For the CosMX and Xenium datasets on this website, the spatial coherence from MULTISPATI might not make a difference, but it might make a difference in this dataset where non-spatial PCs don't show as much spatial structure, at least at the larger scale over the entire tissue section. Voyager 1.2.0 (Bioconductor 3.17) has a faster implementation of MULTISPATI PCA than that of `adespatial`, and is demonstrated in this dataset in [another vignette](https://pachterlab.github.io/voyager/articles/multispati.html).\n",

In contrast, [geographically weighted PCA (GWPCA)](https://rdrr.io/cran/GWmodel/man/gwpca.html) [@Harris2015-sr] can account for spatial heterogeneity. GWPCA runs PCA at each spatial location using only the nearby locations weighed by a kernel. The different locations can have different PCs, and the results can be visualized with \"winning variables\" in each PC, i.e. plotting which feature has the highest loading in each PC in space. This most likely doesn't scale to 400,000 cells, but it would still be interesting when performed on spatially binned data. GWPCA might be added in Bioconductor 3.18 and would require some changes in the user interface, because GWPCA is about the features rather than cell embeddings.\n",

    "# More challenges from large datasets\n",
    "Here, despite the numerous cells, the data was loaded into memory. What if the data doesn't fit into memory? We might write a new vignette with `DelayedArray` demonstrating out of memory data analysis for Bioconductor 3.18. This is already supported by `SingleCellExperiment`, which SFE inherits from. However, the geometries, graphs, and local results can take up a lot memory as well. These can possibly be stored in SQL databases and operated on with [`SQLDataFrame`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SQLDataFrame.html). The geometric operations can be handled by [`sedona`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-sedona), although the options are limited compared to GEOS, which performs geometric operations behind the scene for `sf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another question can be raised about large spatial transcriptomics data: Is it still a good idea to analyze the entire dataset at once? There must be many interesting and unique neighborhoods that might not get the attention they deserve when the whole dataset is analyzed at once. After all, in the geographical space, national level data is usually not analyzed at the block resolution, although a reason for this is privacy of the subjects. County resolution is often used, but there aren't hundreds of thousands of counties. Many analyses are done for cities and counties with neighborhood resolution; using the largest geographical unit isn't always the most relevant. Back to histological space: How to aggregate cells into larger spatial units? How to decide which scale of spatial units (analogous to nation vs state vs county and etc) is relevant? We have traditional anatomical ontologies, such as from the Allen Brain Atlas, but this isn't available for all tissues. Also, with more single cell -omics data, the traditional ontologies can be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, there are 3D thick section single cell resolution spatial transcriptomics data, such as from STARmap [@Wang2018-cv] and EASI-FISH [@Wang2021-fv], although the vast majority of spatial -omics data are from thin sections pretty much _de facto_ 2D. As we mostly live on the surface of Earth, there are many more 2D geospatial resources than 3D. However, some methods can in principle be applied to 3D and the existing software primarily made for 2D data might work. For example, GEOS supports 3D data, so in principle 3D geometries in `sf` should work, although there's little documentation on this. Also, k nearest neighbor, Moran's I, variograms, and etc. should in principle work in 3D, and `gstat` officially supports 3D. These are more challenges related to 3D data:\n",

    "1. Even when multiple z-planes are imaged, the resolution is much lower in the z direction than the x and y directions. Then should the z-plane be treated as an attribute or as a coordinate?\n",
    "2. How to make static plots for 3D data for publications? This is more complicated than plotting z-planes separately, since a 3D block can be sectioned from any other direction. Also for interactive visualization, we need to somehow see through the tissue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the geospatial tradition is only one tradition relevant to large spatial data, and at present `Voyager` only works with vector data. We are uncertain whether raster should be added in a later version, and there are existing tools for large raster data as well, such as [TileDB](https://docs.tiledb.com/geospatial/). Other traditions can be relevant, such as astronomy and image processing, but those are beyond the scope of this package.\n",
