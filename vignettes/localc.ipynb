    "Because multivariate local Geary's C is a spatially weighted sum of squared distances between locations in feature space, it's affected by the curse of dimensionality when used on a large number of features, when uniformly distributed data points in higher dimensions become more equidistant to each other with increasing number of dimensions. However, real data is not uniformly distributed and can have a much smaller effective dimension than the number of features, as many genes are co-regulated. Anselin suggested using the main principal components, but the issue of curse of dimensionality remains to be further investigated. Furthermore, as the cosine and Manhattan distances have been suggested to mitigate curse of dimensionality, I wonder what if I use these instead of the Euclidean distance in feature space for multivariate local Geary's C.\n",
